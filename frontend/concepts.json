  "project": "OrderFlow Backend",
  "highlights": [
    "Spring Boot 3.5 + Java 17 backend that now covers catalog, order, inventory, payment, and outbox modules behind clean controller/service/repository layers",
    "All aggregates extend BaseEntity to inherit UUID identifiers plus auditing timestamps, so Category/Product/Order/Payment records stay consistent out of the box",
    "OrderServiceImpl runs inside a READ_COMMITTED transaction, loads each Product, enforces inventory availability, calculates totals, and flips Orders to PAID as soon as payment succeeds",
    "Inventory is modeled as a one-to-one record per Product with @Version-based optimistic locking and descriptive InsufficientStockException / InventoryNotFoundException errors",
    "PaymentService persists Payment rows, updates the Order status, and emits PaymentCompletedEvent payloads as serialized JSON into the outbox table",
    "An OutboxPublisher scheduled task (dev profile) streams unprocessed events to Kafka topic payment.events and stamps processedAt to prevent duplicate sends",
    "Flyway migrations V1–V3 build the catalog tables, add orders + inventory + payments, and introduce the outbox_event table with a partial index for efficient polling",
    "application-dev wires local Postgres + Kafka while application-test keeps Flyway enabled so Testcontainers integration tests boot the schema exactly like dev",
    "Global validation annotations plus ApiErrorResponse/GlobalExceptionHandler standardize error payloads for Catalog and Order APIs",
    "Dev-only CatalogManualTestRunner seeds data and OrderConcurrencyDemoRunner races two threads against the same inventory row to showcase stock protection"
